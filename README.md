Microchip is a mod that allows the player to keep track of mobs across their world.

## Development
For the sake of simplicity, development for new features will be on the latest version of 1.18, and ported to the versions thereafter.
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the build.gradle in IntelliJ
3. Run the mod!
